Engeto Academy project_2

Your task is to create a program that would simulate Bulls and Cows game.

1. First of all, the computer will generate a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different.
2. Then, in turn, the user tries to guess their computer's number. The computer prompts the user for a number and after the input has been received, the computer responds with the number of matching digits.
3. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".

Bonus
Extend the functionality of the program as you wish. For example

Counting time it took to guess the number
Count the number of guesses and store them in a file and at the end depict user's stats (the best player etc.)
